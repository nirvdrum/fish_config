# Fish nuggets

The fish nuggets project contains various completions and functions for the amazing [Fish shell](http://www.fish-shell.org.)

## Git features

* Provides completion for `git` commands (eg. `git ch<tab>` completes for you)
* Provides completion of branch names for `git branch`

## Rake features

Completion of rake tasks with task description. The first time you type `rake <tab>` we will create a file containing the rake tasks in `/tmp` giving you tab completion of rake tasks. This supports several `Rakefile` locations, so you can use it for different projects.

## Capistrano features

Like Rake, lets you use tab completion for Capistrano tasks.

## Rubygems features

* `edit_gem` with tab completion for gem name lets you view the source for installed gems
* `gem_doc` with tab completion for gem name lets you view Rdoc for installed gems
